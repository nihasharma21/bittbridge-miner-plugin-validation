Model Interface for Bittbridge Miner

This module defines the abstract base class that all predictive models must implement
to work with the Bittbridge subnet. Your custom model must inherit from PredictionModel
and implement the predict() method.

    Abstract base class for all prediction models in the Bittbridge subnet.
    
    All custom models must inherit from this class and implement the predict() method.
    The model is responsible for generating USDT/CNY price predictions and confidence intervals.

        Generate a USDT/CNY price prediction for the given timestamp.
        
        This is the core method that validators will call. It should:
        1. Use the timestamp to determine what prediction to make
        2. Return a point estimate (prediction) and confidence interval
        
        Args:
            timestamp: ISO format timestamp string (e.g., "2024-01-15T10:30:00+00:00")
                     This represents the time from which the prediction should be made.
                     Typically, you'll predict the price 1 hour ahead from this timestamp.
        
        Returns:
            Tuple containing:
            - prediction (Optional[float]): The predicted USDT/CNY price. 
              Return None if prediction cannot be made (e.g., API failure, insufficient data).
            - interval (Optional[List[float]]): A list [lower_bound, upper_bound] representing
              the 90% confidence interval for the prediction.
              Return None if interval cannot be estimated.
        
        Important Notes:
            - Both prediction and interval can be None if the model fails
            - The validator will ignore responses with None predictions (miner gets zero reward)
            - The interval should represent a 90% confidence interval: [lower, upper]
            - Make sure your predictions are reasonable (e.g., USDT/CNY is typically 6-8 range)
        
        Example:
            >>> model = MyCustomModel()
            >>> prediction, interval = model.predict("2024-01-15T10:30:00+00:00")
            >>> print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Interval: {interval}")
            Prediction: 7.25, Interval: [7.10, 7.40]
